## Chapter I

### Preamble

Do you know that your brain is a natural neural net? It consists of 90 billion neurons, on average, that are
interconnected with each other creating 100-1,000 trillion synaptic connections. When one neuron is activated it
transfers its signal or does the opposite – inhibits transferring the signal – to another neuron. In order to do this a
combination of chemicals and electricity is used.

Some research says that there is a hierarchy between neurons in our brain. Some of them are responsible for recognizing
specific basic figures. If they “see” it, they transfer the signal to the next neuron in the hierarchy. This next neuron
might be responsible for recognizing “A”. If it sees it, then it transfers the signal further to another neuron that
might be responsible for “Apple”.

This information was inspiring for people who were occupied in the artificial intelligence field and they decided to
take some of the insights from human brains to create artificial neural networks.

## Chapter II

### Introduction

Artificial neural networks are not that complex as natural ones. They are only inspired by brains. But still, they are a
bit more complicated than classic machine learning algorithms.

In general, nothing changes – it is a subset of machine learning algorithms. Thus, it requires data to make predictions.
It can be used for classification and regression tasks if we talk about classic machine learning tasks.

In this project, you will work only with fully-connected neural networks (FCNN). Those networks consist of neurons where
each of them connected to all the other neurons in the previous and the next layer.

The first layer is called the “input layer”. Each of the neurons in this layer takes the value of a feature. For
example, if you have 15 features in your dataset, you will have 15 neurons in the input layer.

The next layers are called hidden layers. Each of them consists of neurons that make a non-linear transformation of the
input they get. The input is the sum of the product of values and weights from the previous layer. For example, for the
first neuron in the first hidden layer, you will need to multiply each feature value to a weight and then calculate the
sum. The neuron from the hidden layer will pass that sum through an activation function, for example, a sigmoid (like in
logistic regression) and return the value to the next layer. The neurons on the next layer will do the same thing.

The last layer is the output layer. It actually predicts something. For example, if you have a classification task where
you have 4 classes, you will have 3 (n-1) neurons in the output layer.

In this example, you may think about the neural network as an ensemble full of logistic regressions. To train a FCNN
means to find optimal values of weights that minimize the error.

There is the forward propagation mechanism – when you make the calculations (multiplications of weights and values, and
activation functions applications and making predictions). And there is the backward propagation mechanism – when you
have the predictions, you calculate the error and then adjust the weights (for example, via stochastic gradient descent)
from the last layers to the first. Going back and forth, you are training a neural network.

## Chapter III

### Goals

The goal of this project is to give you a first approach to neural networks. You will try to train a multilayer
perceptron (FCNN) using several libraries as well as making the same network using NumPy.

## Chapter IV

### Instructions

* This project will only be evaluated by humans. You are free to organize and name your files as you desire.
* Here and further we use Python 3 as the only correct version of Python.
* The norm is not applied to this project. Nevertheless, you are asked to be clear and structured in the conception of
  your source code.
* Store the datasets in the subfolder data

## Chapter V

### Mandatory part

#### a. Task

In this project, you will work on a churn prediction. You will need to predict which customers are going to stop being
customers of the bank. You will need to use a multilayer perceptron for your final prediction.

* Baseline. Naive classifier where you use the most popular class for predictions.
* Random forest. Solve the task with the random forest as another baseline solution, use grid search to find optimal
  hyperparameters.
* Scikit-learn. Solve the task
  using [MLPClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier.html).
* Keras. Solve the task using Keras from the TensorFlow library.
* TensorFlow. Solve the task using the TensorFlow library.
* NumPy. Implement the best architecture that you achieved earlier but with NumPy using matrix calculations. You need to
  train the model and use it for inference
  (predictions).

#### b. Dataset

You will work with the dataset of one of the Russian banks. It contains different data about their customers: financial
information, their age, services that they used, and the target – whether they left the bank in the next three months.
There are two files: train and test. You will use the train data to fit the models and make predictions for the test
dataset.

> **Note:** You can find the dataset in the project page: "p01_bank_data.zip"

#### c. Implementation

You can work in Jupyter Notebooks. The notebooks should be well-formatted. You need to make a split on the train and
test (20%) datasets with stratification. You may apply any preprocessing for the data: working with anomalies, missing
values, feature generation, and selection. Use a grid search to find the best hyperparameters.

In the last part of the task when you will implement your neural network, please, use OOP principles.

At the end of your notebook(s), you need to create a table with the results of your research where you should display
the name of the library, algorithms, hyperparameters, and the score (accuracy and AUC) of the models you used (including
baseline solutions). Try to use dropout for model regularization.

#### d. Submission

After you finish working with the models, you need to save the final predictions in the CSV-file with only two fields:
“ID” and “TARGET”. The order of IDs should be the same as in the test dataset you were given. The values of “TARGET” can
be either the class or the probability.

You need to achieve AUC at least equal 0.8183 on the test dataset with a neural network solution. It will be calculated
with an automated checker.

Your repository should contain one or several notebooks with your solutions as well as the prediction file.

## Chapter VI

### Bonus part

* Try to achieve a better AUC on the test dataset with a neural network solution – 0.83.
* Try to achieve an even better AUC on the test dataset with a neural network solution – 0.85.

## Chapter VII

### Submission and peer-connection

Submit your work on your Git repository as usual. Only the work on your repository will be graded.

Here are the points that your peer-corrector will have to check:

* there are baseline solutions,
* there are all 4 required implementations of neural networks,
* the score achieved on the test dataset.
